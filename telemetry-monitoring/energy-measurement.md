# Energy Measurement

50 energy sensors are installed in the facility that provide the energy consumption from various resources: Each compute server, each switch, each radio Node and some CPEs and Raspberry UEs.

They are gathered in the prometheus system, so these measurements can be synchronized with an experiment

# Fixed Wireless Access 

FWA/PtMP deployment in the Patras 5G facility site, consisted of one Central Station (CS) and two Terminal Stations (TS). The Central Station was situated on the rooftop of the ECE building, on the same mast as the already installed PtP infrastructure (Figure 1). Terminal Stations were deployed at two different spots in the university campus, at a range of 170m and 580m respectively (Figure 2).

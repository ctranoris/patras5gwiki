# Experimentation Process

Patras5G facility adopts the Network Slice as a Service (NSaaS) delivery model, whereby the Patras5G facility provisions tailored network slices to verticals upon request. Each vertical uses the slice that has been provided to meet their requirements for trialling activities, setting up different use cases and assessing their KPIs under different network conditions.
Patras5G facility incorporates into its architecture the guidelines from telecom industry organisations and the normative specifications from standards bodies to ensure interoperability and reproducibility. The Patras5G facility is based on Openslice (http://openslice.io)  which allows NSaaS delivery model is shown in next Figure, where the Patras5G portal and service catalogue expose TM Forum Open APIs towards verticals to allow them to directly trigger necessary operations for service ordering. The Patras5G Service Catalogue derives content from Patras5G Facility Service Catalogue offerings. The vertical's service order is then passed to the Service Orchestrator (SO) in Patras5G facility. The SO then instantiates the network slice by subsequent calls to the respective network function orchestrator (NFVO). The NFVO implements the northbound interface using ETSI SOL 005. This normative specification defines the protocol and data model for the interface capabilities in the form of RESTful APIs which have become de-facto solutions for most of the industrial and open-source NFVOs.

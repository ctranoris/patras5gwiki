The Patras5G testbed hosts a next generation networks pre-commercial site, based on ERICSSON 5G Rel-17 and beyond equipment. The site hosts several 5G radios indoors and outdoors located at the area of UoP, as well as a dedicated edge User Plane Function - UPF, while the 5G Core is co-located remotely in Athens containing all related functions (Access Mobility Function-AMF, Session Management Function-SMF, Network Exposure Function-NEF, etc) by a Greek operator NOVA which hosts a dedicated slice for PNET. This extension offers a unique opportunity to test 5G/6G cloud to edge scenarios, as well as various non-public-network deployments, using NOVAâ€™s licensed spectrum.
